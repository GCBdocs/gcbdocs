### Copy Trading User Guide

#### 1. What is Copy Trading?

Copy Trading is a powerful feature that enables copiers to mimic the trades of multiple elite traders. By automatically aligning with these traders’ trading activities, copiers can potentially generate profits or incur losses. The beauty of copy trading lies in its ability to save users from the hassle of manually opening and closing positions and constantly monitoring the market. When you copy a trader, all their trades are replicated automatically.

#### 2. Types of Copy Trading

**2.1 Copy by Fixed Amount**

With this method, you directly copy the number of orders placed by the trader. If your account balance is insufficient, the maximum number of orders you can place is calculated based on your available balance.

**2.2 Copy by a Fixed Percentage**

In this approach, the “Order Amount” is calculated proportionally. It’s determined by referencing the ratio of each order placed by the trader to their futures balance. Based on this ratio and your desired copy trading amount, the order amount for each trade is calculated using the following formula:

* **Order amount of the follower** = (Trader’s deposit) / (Trader’s available balance) \* (Follower’s copy amount)

Additionally, the opening value for the follower is calculated as:

* **Opening value of the follower** = (Trader’s deposit) / (Trader’s available balance) \* (Follower’s copy amount) \* (Margin multiple)
