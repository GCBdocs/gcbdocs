# Platform fee

## Fees Explanation

Our platform employs a transparent and straightforward fee structure to support trading activities. When you engage in trading, fees are applied based on the type of order you place:

* **Maker Fees**: When you create an order that adds liquidity to the market (e.g., placing a limit order), a small fee is applied. This incentivizes users to contribute to market depth.
* **Taker Fees**: When you fulfill an existing order (e.g., executing a market order), a slightly higher fee is charged. This reflects the convenience of immediate order fulfillment.
