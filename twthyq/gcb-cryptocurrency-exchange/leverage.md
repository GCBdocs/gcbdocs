* **How does GCB Leveraged Token work?**

Each GCB Leveraged Token is a unit share of a leveraged fund. The fund manager ensures that the fund returns are based on a specific multiple of the underlying asset and that traders can gain that specific multiple of profits of the underlying asset. When the price volatility on the opposite side exceeds the threshold, a rebalancing mechanism is used to hedge risks to control the net loss.
