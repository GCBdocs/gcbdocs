## P2P (peer to peer)

In a P2P system, users can send and receive money using a secure platform, allowing them to trade cryptocurrencies or convert them to fiat currency easily. The process works by allowing users to connect with each other on a marketplace or platform where they can create and accept offers for buying or selling digital assets. Once both parties agree on the terms, the transaction is processed securely, ensuring that funds are transferred quickly and efficiently.

One of the main advantages of P2P transfers for users is the increased flexibility and convenience they offer. Users can transact at their preferred times, often with lower fees compared to traditional banking methods. Additionally, P2P transfers provide a more accessible way to trade cryptocurrencies, enabling users to exchange funds directly with others in their network. This direct exchange can lead to faster transactions and greater control over the process, enhancing the overall user experience.

To ensure compliance with international regulations, users must complete a Know Your Customer (KYC) process before they can access crypto-to-fiat conversions. The KYC process involves verifying the identity of users by collecting essential information, such as government-issued identification, proof of address, and other relevant personal details. This step is crucial for preventing fraud and money laundering, ensuring that all transactions meet legal requirements.

In addition to the KYC process, GCB has integrated secure payment gateways to facilitate both withdrawals and deposits efficiently. These payment gateways enhance transaction security, providing users with a safe and streamlined experience when managing their funds. By implementing robust KYC measures alongside secure payment processing, GCB upholds its commitment to regulatory compliance and customer safety.
