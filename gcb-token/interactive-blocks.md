Adjusted Token Distribution

Calculation

Total Supply: 2,500,000,000 tokens

Burn Period: 48 months

Then 100,000,000 will be locked in a smart contract till the end of this cycle, then TBA.

#### Token Burn Mechanism

Our token implements an 86.2% burn of the total supply through a structured and transparent process, and the burn will proceed as follows:

* The wallets to be burned will be divided over the course of 48 months and we have a surprise wallet to remove the predictability factor.
* We are free to utilise the surprise mechanism factor as long as we burn all the tokens intended for the first cycle.&#x20;
* This alternating burn cycle will continue until all have been burned, ensuring a gradual reduction of the token supply across both chains.

This deflationary strategy aims to increase scarcity over time, potentially adding value to the remaining tokens. For full transparency, each burn will be publicly verified on BSC Blockchain and Tron blockchain explorers.
