# Vesting Period

#### **Vesting Overview**

Vesting schedules ensure that investors receive their tokens in a controlled manner over a specified period. This helps protect the project from large sell-offs immediately after the Token Generation Event (TGE) and aligns long-term goals between investors and the project's success.

**Angel Investors (Silent Investors)**

* **Allocation**: 7.5% of the total token supply
* **Total Tokens Allocated**: 22,736,000 tokens
* **Initial Unlock at TGE**: 15% (3,410,400 tokens)
* **Remaining Tokens**: 19,325,600 tokens (to be unlocked)
* **Vesting Period**: The remaining 85% of the tokens (19,325,600 tokens) will be unlocked gradually over **48 months** through monthly releases.

**Key Details**:

* Silent angel investors will receive 15% of their total allocation at the time of the Token Generation Event (TGE).
* After the TGE, the remaining 85% of the tokens will be distributed monthly over 48 months. This gradual release helps prevent immediate sell-offs and encourages long-term commitment.

**Private Sale**

* **Allocation**: 8% of the total token supply
* **Total Tokens Allocated**: 23,520,000 tokens
* **Initial Unlock**: No lock-up period at TGE
* **Vesting Period**: 100% of the tokens will be unlocked monthly over 48 months.

**Key Details**:

* Private sale investors will not have an initial lock-up period at the TGE.
* The full allocation of tokens will be distributed monthly over 48 months, allowing private sale participants to gradually unlock their tokens.

#### **Vesting Schedule Importance**

Vesting schedules for angel investors and private sale participants ensure stakeholders are committed to the project’s long-term success. This gradual unlocking mechanism provides stability in the token market, as it prevents large amounts of tokens from being sold off too quickly, which could destabilize the token’s value.&#x20;
